# DevJS
Correcting and storing self-introduction letters for job seekers in the IT field.

## 1. Project Overview

### ðŸ“Œ DevJS (Developer's Job Script) is an AI-based self-introduction correction service for job seekers in the IT field.
- Existing correction services are evaluated only on a set basis, but
- DevJS allows users to directly enter keywords (JD elements, etc.) that they want to emphasize in their cover letter,
- AI evaluates how well the keyword is reflected in the cover letter.
- After that, we provide reference examples and customized recommended sentences to make up for the shortcomings.

> This helps you write a strength-oriented cover letter that is more consistent with job openings.

## 2. Key Functions

### 1) Correct the cover letter
- When the user enters a cover letter and emphasis keyword,
- Search for similar cover letters using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline and reflect them in feedback.
- Evaluation of keyword reflectivity and recommendation of sentences based on RAG DB for insufficient parts
- Provides correction feedback in terms of grammar, context, and readability.
